NUIM WiFi is an Android application that automatically authenticates you with the NUIMWireless network. This means that you will never be redirected to the NUIM login page and asked to enter your student number and password ever again.

Steps

1) Install the application from GooglePlay
2) Enter your details into the user interface
3) Press save 

From now on whenever you connect to the NUIMWireless the NUIMWiFi service will automatically submit your student number and password and authenticate you with the server.
Once you have saved your username and password you can remove the NUIMWiFi launcher from your home screen. You don't need to use it again unless your details change.

Disclaimer: NUIMWiFi is NOT an official app provided by the National University of Ireland Maynooth.
